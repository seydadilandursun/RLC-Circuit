# RLC-Circuit
##$$How can I calculate impedance in an RLC circuit?
To calculate impedance in an RLC circuit follow these steps:

<ul>  <li> Determine whether the circuit is in series or parallel.

  <li> Measure the resistance R using the multimeter.

 <li> Find the inductance L.

 <li> Measure the capacitance C.

 <li> Define the frequency of the circuit f.

 <li> Evaluate angular frequency:

ω = 2πf

<ul> Calculate the impedance of the series RLC circuit from the formula:

Z = √(R²+(ωL-1/ωC)²)

<ul> Find the impedance of the parallel RLC circuit:

Z = 1/√(1/R² + (1/ωL - ωC)²) $$ ##
