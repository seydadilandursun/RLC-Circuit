How can I calculate impedance in an RLC circuit?

To calculate impedance in an RLC circuit follow these steps:



       1. Determine R,L,C,f 
   
       2. Write calculate_impedance(R, L, C, f) function
   
       3. Find the impedance of the parallel RLC circuit by this equation:  Z = 1/√(1/R² + (1/ωL - ωC)²) while w = 2*pi*f
