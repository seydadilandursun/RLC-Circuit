How can I calculate impedance in an RLC circuit?

To calculate impedance in an RLC circuit follow these steps:


       1. Determine whether the circuit is in series or parallel. 

       2.  Measure the resistance R using the multimeter. 
    
       3. Find the inductance L. 
   
       4. Measure the capacitance C. 
     
       5. Define the frequency of the circuit f. <
   
       6. Evaluate angular frequency: ω = 2πf 
    
       7. Calculate the impedance of the series RLC circuit from the formula: $$ Z = √(R²+(ωL-1/ωC)²) $$
   
       8. Find the impedance of the parallel RLC circuit:$$ Z = 1/√(1/R² + (1/ωL - ωC)²)$$
