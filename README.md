##$$How can I calculate impedance in an RLC circuit?
To calculate impedance in an RLC circuit follow these steps:

<ul> 
       1. Determine whether the circuit is in series or parallel. 

       2.  Measure the resistance R using the multimeter. 
    
        3.Find the inductance L. 
   
        Measure the capacitance C. 
     
        Define the frequency of the circuit f. <
   
        Evaluate angular frequency: ω = 2πf 
    
       Calculate the impedance of the series RLC circuit from the formula: $$ Z = √(R²+(ωL-1/ωC)²) $$
   
       Find the impedance of the parallel RLC circuit:$$ Z = 1/√(1/R² + (1/ωL - ωC)²)$$  
     
</ul>
